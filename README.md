MUX-521 | Elevating the UI Experience: HTML5 Development Utilizing the Crestron Library
Beyond CH5! This class will look at HTML user interface creation, with a vanilla approach combined with the CrComLib for the connection to the control system.

We will start by creating a contract and then learn how to utilize standard web frameworks to create your own user interface elements. We will focus on building a Crestron UI using the Angular and React frameworks. Together, we will build a functional user interface that you can use as a launchpad for your projects.
